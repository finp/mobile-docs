= Provisioning and Configuring Mobile Clients

A mobile client is the representation on OpenShift of the Mobile App that you want to implement. 
You require a mobile client for each mobile platform you want to develop an app for and you must connect it to each mobile service you want to use. 
In OpenShift, you can navigate to the mobile client and download the configuration from the mobile client into your development environment. For example:

[source,json,indent=0,role="primary"]
.Android
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feedhenry/mobile-security-android-template/master/app/src/main/assets/mobile-services.json[]
----

[source,json,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.iOS
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feedhenry/mobile-security-ios-template/master/secure-ios-app/mobile-services.json[]
----

NOTE: If you do not see the mobile service you require in this file, you must connect the mobile client to that service as described in xref:connecting-mobile-clients-to-mobile-services.adoc[].
